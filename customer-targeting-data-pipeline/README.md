# Customer Targeting Data Pipeline

## Exciting News from Our Tech Team! üöÄüöÄ

We're thrilled to unveil our latest initiative: the Customer Targeting Data Pipeline. This cutting-edge project integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Pyke's rule-based logic to redefine how we understand and interact with our customers, significantly enhancing our marketing efforts and customer engagement.

## Project Overview üîç

Our pipeline orchestrates a seamless flow from robust data collection to advanced preprocessing, predictive modeling, and dynamic, rule-based decision-making using Pyke. This integration enables us to precisely target the right customers with the most suitable campaigns, optimizing our marketing strategies and maximizing ROI.

## ‚ú® Purpose

This pipeline aims to utilize ML to predict customer behaviors and refine these insights into actionable strategies using Pyke's rule-based system. Our goal is to deliver personalized customer experiences that not only engage but also convert, by leveraging data-driven insights to drive our marketing decisions.

## üîß Tech Highlights

- **Machine Learning**: Utilizing TensorFlow and PyTorch, we develop predictive models that forecast customer behaviors and value, enhancing how we target and engage users.
- **Pyke Integration**: Implements flexible, rule-based logic that adapts to the dynamic market and customer base, allowing for nuanced marketing strategies.
- **Data Management**: Robust data storage solutions like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery ensure our data's integrity and scalability.
